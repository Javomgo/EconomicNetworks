```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=7, fig.height=7,  fig.align="center", echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)

Consider the graph in Figure 1.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1", out.width = '30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("dibufull1.png")
```

*1)* Enter it as a graph $G$. The letters should be the names of the nodes (an attribute). Plot it.

```{r}
G<-graph(c("A","E","E","H","H","F","F","G","F","D","F","C","G","D","D","C","C","B","B","D"), directed=F)
plot (G)
```

*2)* Oops! I forgot an arc connecting nodes *A* and *F*. Add it to $G$. Plot the new graph $G$.


```{r}
G<-G+edge(c("A","F"))
plot(G)
```


*3)* Obtain its vectors of edges and nodes.


```{r}
E(G)
V(G)

```

*4)* Obtain the adjacency matrix of $G$.


```{r}
get.adjacency(G)
```

*5)* Define a new graph $H$ from this adjacency matrix. Plot it. Check that it is isomorphic to $G$.


```{r}
H<-graph_from_adjacency_matrix(G[], "undirected")
plot(H)
isomorphic(G,H)
```

*6)* Find the order, the size and the density of $G$. Name them $n$, $m$ and $dens$ and call their values in the sentence following the chunk.

```{r}
n<-gorder(G)
m<-gsize(G)
dens<-graph.density(G)
```

The order of $G$ is `r n`, its size is `r m`, and its density is `r dens`.

*7)* Find the node, or the nodes, of largest degree in $G$. Check on the plot that the answer is right. You should be able to give a function that produces the answer and call it **max.deg**, without having to check by hand the vector of degrees, and to call its value in the sentence following the chunk.

```{r}
max.deg=V(G)$name[degree(G)==max(degree(G))]
max.deg
```

The node(s) of largest degree is (are) `r max.deg`.



*8)* Now define from scratch a directed graph $G_0$ from  the graph in Figure 1, considering each arc oriented in the alphabpetic order of its ends.

```{r}
G_0<-graph(c("A","E","E","H","F","H","F","G","D","F","C","F","D","G","C","D","B","C","B","D"))
plot (G_0)
```

*9)* Obtain its vectors of arcs and nodes.

```{r}
E(G_0)
V(G_0)
```

*10)* Obtain the adjacency matrix of $G_0$.

```{r}
get.adjacency(G_0)
```

*11)* Remove the node *D* from $G_0$, and add to it new arcs between its neighbors, corresponding to directed paths of length 2 in $G_0$ traversing *D*. Plot the resulting graph.

```{r}
G_0=delete_vertices(G_0,c("D"))
G_0=add.edges(G_0,c("B","G","B","F","C","G","C","F"))
plot(G_0)
```

*12)* If the resulting digraph is not simple, simplify it and plot it again. Let $G_1$ be the resulting graph.
   
```{r}
G_1=simplify(G_0)
plot(G_1)
```

*13)* Find the node, or the nodes, of largest in-degree and of largest out-degree in $G_1$. 


```{r}
max.indegree=max.deg=V(G_1)$name[degree(G_1, mode="in")==max(degree(G_1, mode="in"))]
max.outdegree=max.deg=V(G_1)$name[degree(G_1, mode="out")==max(degree(G_1, mode="out"))]
```

The node(s) of largest in-degree is(are)  `r max.indegree` and the node(s) of largest out-degree is(are) `r max.outdegree`.
